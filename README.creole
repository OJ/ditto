ditto takes a Windows exe as input and copies the resources

of that binary into the target binary. Resources are usually

icons, copywright info and descriptions of the binary. 

== Example usage:

Usage output:
<pre>
C:\>ditto.exe

ditto - binary resource mirrorer
--------------------------------------------------------------------

C:\>ditto.exe sourcebin.exe targetbin.exe


C:\>
</pre>

Copy (no output):
<pre>
C:\>ditto.exe C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe evilbin.exe

C:\>
</pre>

** Disclaimer: does not work with Metasploit In-memory: **
<pre>
meterpreter > upload evilbin.exe
[*] uploading  : evilbin.exe -> evilbin.exe
[*] uploaded   : evilbin.exe -> evilbin.exe
meterpreter > execute -H -i -c -d calc.exe -m -f ditto.exe -a 'C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe evilbin.exe'

But does not result in a file change of any kind and sometimes results in meterpreter dieing.
